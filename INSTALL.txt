
Building instructions for the PropEditor applet: 

unzip the PropEditor.zip file provided
	you will have README.txt, an example prop file, the HTML file, a pre-compiled/signed .jar file, and the net/widgetron/propeditorapplet directories with the .java files and SuggestionFile.txt in them
	you may want to copy the PropEditor.jar out of this directory to avoid overwriting it when you generate your own jar
	
compile the java source code: 
	javac net/widgetron/propeditorapplet/*.java
	
compress the classes and the SuggestionFile.txt into a Jar: 
	jar -cf PropEditor.jar net/widgetron/propeditorapplet/*.class net/widgetron/propeditorapplet/SuggestionFile.txt

create a key to sign the jar with: 
	keytool -genkey -alias PropEditor -keystore whatever
	[follow the prompts]
	
sign the jar with your created key: 
	jarsigner PropEditor.jar PropEditor


with the PropEditor.html and PropEditor.jar in the same directory, continue with the README.txt
